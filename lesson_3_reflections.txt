When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to collaborate with more people or maybe when I don't have enough
    space.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because it could cause a conflict with my local work.
