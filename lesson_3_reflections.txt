When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to collaborate with more people or maybe when I don't have enough
    space.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because it could cause a conflict with my local work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are used to clone a repository from someone's GitHub account to yours.
    Clones are used to copy a repository from GitHub to your local directory, or
    between two local directories.
    Branches are used to change the project without changing the original files.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It's important because then you can work offline.
