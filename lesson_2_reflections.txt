What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	A .git file is created. We need to do this to start saving commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	The staging area is an intermediate area between the working directory and the
	repository. This area offers the possibility to add files one at a time before
	committing.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	I can run the 'git status' command to see a list of the changes to be commited.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	Branches would be helpful to experiment with new features or maybe work on
	another version of your program.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	It's very helpful, because it shows a tree diagram with the different branches.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

	The result is that all the commits are now part of the checked-out branch.
	These commits are sorted by timestamp.
