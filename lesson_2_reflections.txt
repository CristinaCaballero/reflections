What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	A .git file is created. We need to do this to start saving commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is an intermediate area between the working directory and the
	repository. This area offers the possibility to add files one at a time before
	committing.
